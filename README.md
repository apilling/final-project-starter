In the class activity today, we got to implement access to our webpage, a welcome page, a button that increments a counter, a button that decrements the counter, and a button to set the counter to 0. Our major constraint was time, as we only had 10 minutes sprints in class to do the features. Our user stories were way overestimated, as we we're able to complete 5 of the tasks within small 10 minute sprints. We could probably scale down the user stories to be within a range of 1-3, instead of 1-5.
